$text = "PHP, short for \"Hypertext Preprocessor\", is a server-side scripting language first introduced in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. Distributed under a permissive license, PHP is open-source, allowing both personal and commercial use at no cost. It's a cross-platform language, compatible with various server operating systems like Linux, Windows, and macOS, making it highly versatile. The language boasts a large and supportive community, offering an extensive range of libraries, frameworks, and online resources, which has made it a staple for developing dynamic websites and web applications. One of its significant advantages is its seamless integration with relational databases such as MySQL.\nPHP is designed with a syntax that many find user-friendly, although the ease of learning can be subjective and vary from person to person. The language allows for efficient coding; tasks like outputting text can be performed with simple commands like echo. Variables are easily declared, and PHP offers a comprehensive set of control structures, including conditional statements and loops, providing a balance between simplicity and functionality.\nWhile PHP is most commonly used for server-side web development, its capabilities extend beyond that scope. The language has evolved to include command-line scripting and even the creation of desktop applications. However, its primary utility remains in server-side scripting, making it a robust and flexible choice for everything from small websites to complex web-based applications.";
